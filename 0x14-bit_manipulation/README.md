Bit manipulation in C-programming involves working with the individual bits of a binary number. This can be useful in situations where you need to manipulate individual bits of data, such as when working with hardware or performing encryption. 

In C, you can use bitwise operators to manipulate individual bits. These operators include: 
- & (bitwise AND)
- | (bitwise OR)
- ^ (bitwise XOR)
- << (left shift)
- >> (right shift)
- ~ (bitwise NOT)

For example, if you wanted to set the 3rd bit of a binary number to 1, you could use the bitwise OR operator like this:
```
int num = 0b0000; // binary representation of 0
num |= (1 << 2); // set the 3rd bit to 1
```
This would result in `num` being equal to `0b0100`.

Let me know if you have any specific questions or if you'd like me to go into more detail about a particular operator!
